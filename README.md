# Ten Meter Walk App:

This app allows user to conduct and save a Ten Meter Walk Test. 
Users will be given the ability to coduct three trial runs to measure how fast
a patient can walk ten meters. The user chooses when to start and stop each 
trial. When users have completed all three trial runs, then they will be 
presented with an option to save the Test for later reference. Users also
have the ability to look at old tests and edit some notes from the test.

* Currently not working since the DB service I was using is no longer available. 

### Built With:
